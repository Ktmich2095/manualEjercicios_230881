    <h1>How I feel about Angular</h1>
    <article>
<p>Angular is my favorite framework, and this is why. Angular has the coolest deferrable view feature that makes defer loading content the easiest and most ergonomic it could possibly be.</p>
</article>
    @defer (on viewport) {
        <app-practica10-aux />
    } @placeholder {
        <p>Future comments</p>
    } @loading (minimum 2s)  {
        <p>Loading comments...</p>
    }
  </div>
